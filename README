This is a program that I wrote for my COMS W3137 
Data Structures and Algorithms course. 

Main: 	TSPTester.java

To Run:	javac TSPTester.java
	java TSPTester

DESIGN

This incorporates a GUI which takes a user input 
integer and creates that amount of points in 
random locations. The remaining buttons in the GUI
perform incremental actions towards creating an
optimal path between the points. The last actually
uses brute force to compute the TSP solution. With
large input integers, the running time of this 
action obviously becomes excessively long.
